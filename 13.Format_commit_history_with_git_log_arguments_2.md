## Format commit history

```
git log -[number of commits]
```
Shows [number of commits] counting backwards from the last one.

```
git log --after="[first date]" --before="[last date]"
```
Shows all commits after *first date* and before *last date*. Git parses the date that is sent to parser so it supports a lot of *common formats*.

`since` and `until` can be used instead of `after` and `before`.

Examples:

- 30 minutes ago
- last tuesday
- last week
- 2 weeks ago
- 3/15/16

```
git log --author [word]
```
Filters commit log by the [word] printing commits which author name or email matches the word.

*[word]* can also be a regular expression.

```
git log --grep="[string]"
```

Prints commits which commit messages match the [string] which can be a regex too.

```
git log -S"[string]"
```

Prints all commits that use the [string] in the code changes. Could search for a regex if instead of `-S` we use `-G` and remove the `""`

**Tip**: Use `-p` option to show the code that changed and `-i` to ignore case.

```
git log --no-merges
```

Prints all the commits excluding the merge commits

```
git log [reference]..[another reference]
```

Prints all commits between two references

Example:
`git log master..cool-feature` only prints commits between *master* and *cool-feature* two branches

```
git log [file1] [file2]
```

Logs the commits that interacted with the provided files.


**Every argument sent to log command can be composed**
