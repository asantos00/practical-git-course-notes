## Know files with conflicts (after `git pull`)

While on merge
```
git status
```

This will print the files that have conflicts. To solve the conflicts open the file and read the next section.

## Merging file

```
function getInitials(name) {
  return name.split(' ')
<<<<<<< HEAD
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase())
=======
    .map(word => `${word.charAt(0).`)
>>>>>>> [commit hash]
    .join('')
}
```

The code between `HEAD` and `=======` is the code that is in your computer, your current branch.
The code between `=======` and the commit hash is the from the remote.

After changing the file, `git add -A` and `git commit -m [message]` as normal
